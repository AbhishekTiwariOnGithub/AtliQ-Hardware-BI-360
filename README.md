# AtliQ-Hardware-BI-360 Project Overview

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Hardware, a rapidly expanding global consumer electronics company, has relied on intuitions, surveys, and basic Excel data analysis for making business decisions. This outdated approach has led to ineffective decision-making, causing significant financial losses.
In response, the company is urgently seeking to build a data analytics team to enhance its ability to make data-driven decisions.

## Objective:

Design an interactive report offering invaluable insights across finance, sales, marketing, supply chain, and executive teams, using the provided mockup dashboards as a reference.

Note: This project was a part of Codebasics PowerBI Bootcamp 2.0
